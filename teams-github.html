    <h1>MS Teams and Github Usage</h1>
    <h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>We used GitHub almost exclusively for file sharing and group contributions via git commits.
  This allowed us to keep a track of group member’s individual contribution, as well as see the progress
   of everyone’s work. This worked very well, and we found that being able to pull the group’s in-progress work
    allowed us to give feedback and help each other in group meetings.
As such, the audit trail on the Git repository does accurately reflect the group’s contribution. Each person committed
 their work to the repository, and you can see clearly how often and when each person was working on their assignment.
</p>
<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>We held meetings twice weekly using the Microsoft Teams platform.
Below are the meeting links, as well as their agendas and actions as they were taken:
