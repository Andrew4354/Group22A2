<p> <h2>Machine Learning </h2> <br><br>
‘Machine Learning is a set of techniques that sits inside the even more ambitious goal of artificial intelligence’- Crash Course: Machine Learning (YouTube)
There are two main types of AI, weak and strong. Weak AI functions based on data input and can process this data to form one specific function and is generally very 1 dimensional. Examples of this form of AI would be Classifiers. Strong AI functions on a more comparable level to the human brain, where true internal learning can take place. Although a true strong AI has yet to be developed, AI like IBM’s Watson, Summit or Sierra are good examples of how far we have come in AI technology.
It is hard to fully understand AI without looking deep into the complex algorithms that produce the core functions, but for the purposes of this report I will give an overview of just the functions and outputs.
At the core of weak AI lives classifiers. Classifiers reduce real world data into ‘features’ (values that usefully characterise the things we wish to classify) Training data is used to compare features using decision trees and the AI is able to make assumptions based on this data. The amount of data stored in a classifier can be astronomical and allow the AI to have incredibly in-depth predictions or classifications.
Artificial Neurons give these classifiers the ability to produce ‘machine learning’. Based on the neural network within the human brain. As opposed to the human brain where these signals are chemical and electrical, the artificial neurons send signals in the form of numbers.
 Artificial Neurons function as a data processing power houses. Each ’neuron’ has a data input and output function. The neuron’s work collaboratively to take the series of inputs, combines them, and emits multiple signals with different values. Each neuron produces a slightly different value based on the data input and then the algorithms allow for the data patterns to be understood by the AI.
Some of the key Weak AI milestones in the area of neural networks are face recognition, driverless cars and translating human speech.
Strong AI has yet to reach or surpass human intelligence. It is widely debated whether or not this feat can be achieved by a computer but nevertheless strong AI seems to be only just around the corner.
Reinforcement learning, like that of Google’s Alpha Go is one of the functions of these near strong AI. It allows the AI to practice a single function millions of times over to produce better, more informed strategy or knowledge.
The mass amount of digitised knowledge (Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook etc.) coupled with the ability of reinforcement is believed by many to be the perfect starting point for a true strong AI.
The future of AI is limitless but in the next 3 years some technologies will definitely be more refined. A good example is driverless cars.
The technology and rollout of driverless technology is only a few years away with pioneers such as Tesla currently setting up infrastructure to
support this technology. AI phone assistants are another technology that is believed to be more functional in the near future. Allowing users to have their
phone know when to book and appointment and to do this autonomously. <br><br>

With AI technology on the cusp of so many great innovations, improvements in all aspects of human life will be seen. Sunil Kumar of
 Towards Data Science outlines some of these positive aspects as reduction in human error, faster decisions and new inventions. Erasing human error
  could be seen as an example, in a surgery room an AI machine can perform precise movements and incisions for tricky surgery. Faster decisions
  relate to the manufacturing of anything being replicated in a faster manner through the use of an AI thought process rather than a much slower human brain.
Most of the initial impacts of will only be felt by the people in first world countries and more than likely the top 20% of people within those countries. Autonomous driving technology,
medical technology, Phone assistants and AI for manual tasks are things that will only become available to people of wealth.
It is not all happy days though, Bernard Marr and Co’s What Are the Negative Impacts of Artificial Intelligence (AI)? Cites Job Loss, AI terrorism, AI
bias and accelerated hacking as some of the worrying issues related to the progress of Artificial Intelligence. Bernard describes AI bias as the bias the machine is designed with based
on the AI creator, meaning that the AI could be designed with the mal intent of its creator. This links into AI terrorism and says more about people then it does about AI.
Accelerated hacking will be more common as AI computers get faster and smarter. Job loss will be seen much like that of the blacksmith and horse carriage driver, but this also creates jobs on the other side.
Machine learning in the realms of marketing, advertisement and general consumerism will be felt by most people, however. The impacts of this will only further
 the capitalist mentality of modern society and whether this is better or worse is really an individual perception.<br><br>

As a person looking to enter the field of IT, I believe most aspects of my life will be improved by the innovations that we will see over the coming decades in relation to AI.
In my day-to-day life things like driverless cars and phone assistants will be technologies that I will utilise. Other aspects of AI such as medical advances in the realms of AI will also improve my life, just not on a da-to-day scale.
I do not think initially a lot would be different for me, a lot of the AI functions we have talked about in this report are many years away and even when they do become widely accessible, they will be extremely expensive.
Both my parents work in jobs that could be completed by a robot and lucky for them they are about to retire. My father is a forklift operator,
and my mother is in administration at a mechanics workshop. It is because of this aspect that I have put a lot of time and effort
into choosing my future career path. I decided to be the person creating, rather than the person getting replaced.<br><br>

<h2>Natural Language processing and Chatterbots</h2><br><br>
Natural Language processing is a technological advancement that originates in 1950 when Alan Turing published the well-known article “Computing, Machinery and Intelligence” an
article that discussed “The Imitation Game” which we now call the Turing Test. Natural Language Processing is a system we have developed over the decades with numerous functions,
from sentiment analysis to text to speech and speech to text voice commands. The most common thing built from NLP is the chatbot/s Alexa and Siri, we send commands, share data
and these services respond as human as possible. Which is the point of the Imitation Game,
to determine the intelligence of a machine indistinguishable from that of a human.<br><br>

With NLP we can understand a foreign country spokesperson’s speech as they are saying it, be it through a vocal translator or subtitles
we have developed tools and technology that allows us to not only communicate more effectively with machines but with the world at large.
 In the next few years starting from early 2020 it was expected in the next 3-5 years some more ground-breaking advancements in existing
 technology would be on the rise, from AI and Machine learning developments to Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality systems. Whilst VR is
  still very much hanging in the balance it still is on the forefront of many developer minds, AR is also steadily growing into a marvel of
  its own kind. If you think the current list of things Natural Language Processing can do now is impressive with Siri, Alexa and other Chatbots
  and AI imagine what the future of data gathering and data processing will be but to try and pin down exactly what we are going to see in the future is a lot harder than one would imagine.<br><br>

As mentioned, NLP has provided us tools known as chatbots, in its simple forms we have seen them as social media extensions that provide quick understanding of the system’s functions. Though there are more advanced forms of chatbot technology, such as Siri or Alexa; mobile assistant software
that when activated and communicated with in different forms provide services and data upon request. For example, Alexa could be connected to alarm systems, mobile phones, and other devices and with a simple phrase.
“Alexa intruder alert!” These systems could be set off simultaneously providing much needed security. Siri and Alexa both provide information by asking simple,
non-open questions and these answers can be links, images or just outright readings of articles using text to speech functions.<br><br>

With countless emerging industries, companies, developers, and programmers the end of NLP and what it can accomplish is still nowhere in sight, because
while its initial goal was to take raw language input and transform it through different means to better enrich and deliver higher quality data,
there is so much more that can be done. With chat bots we could develop an AI that could answer simple medical concepts to potentially deliver decent
treatments of casual injury. We could have a chatbot that in its design allows people suffering anxiety, depression, and other mental illness an
opportunity to receive a rapid, real time and seemingly human response with the tap of a few buttons.<br><br>

Change and risk are always a concern, especially when it comes to technology, jobs can become automated, human error can damage a system
 or users can abuse the services provided through NLP. The most likely change we are going to see is a change in how we use technology
 and how it responds to us in general, this could be Augmented Reality where we can work from home in a semi digital space, or simply better
 home AI for cleaning, watering gardens and taking voice commands with better precision. The most likely impact on the world much like its
 development is also widely unknown, the only real jobs ready to be made redundant by Natural Language Processing is the job of Data Scientists,
 who have the role of understanding and explaining NLP and in the smallest way it may also make people who sit and answer FAQs and help desk
 operators redundant. There are threats to how NLP interacts with us and itself, people who feed the AI with bad data can influence how it
 manages itself and how it conducts it activities. A good example is in 2016; Tay, Microsoft’s artificial intelligence, was released.
 Twitter users bombarded it with so much bad information that almost anything Tay said would be inappropriate or racist. Granted, a
 lot of these things were created through a function that repeated back what someone has said. This allowed Tay to create and tweet some
 very strange and dangerous tweets. As with any technological advancement there comes risk with downsizing in business’, corrupt users and
 even programmers creating bad technological habits, but these risks are not worth halting Natural Language Processing from moving forward.<br><br>

I think something that may help me and the world at large with NLP and chatbot technology is a better and easier line of communication between
government and citizens via many forms automation in call centres as right now the inability to communicate in a fast and on demand fashion
with our welfare systems, or civic issues is next to impossible. I can also see a positive change for my partner and other individuals who
have diabetes and other medical physical health problems with the advancements in machine learning coupled with NLP, managing it could become
a more automated and precise process with less risks of failure because as it stands right now when it comes to something diabetes management
it is only possible for rare few people with a decent income or government subsidised orders who can manage their condition with ease.
There is a chance that many people in my family who suffer from mental illness’ they would, or I hope should, be able to communicate with a chatbot
or other service in a clear and precise manner to get directed to the best possible help they can get based on their needs and requirements.
Ultimately, I feel that almost any change in how we communicate and how machines function will be a great thing to be a part of, be it hlping
in NLP development or simply benefiting from the many tools it provides us regardless of how long it takes to get there.<br><br>

<h2>Robots</h2><br><br>
Robotics covers a wide range of implementation from autonomous vehicles to personal assistants, to chefs, wait staff, cashiers, and the huge development spike in bionics. Robotics we commonly see today are autonomous vacuum cleaners or personal assistants (such as Amazon Alexa or the Google nest series,) these robots are known as consumer robots. However, robots that are used in industrial scale projects are becoming more and more advanced, but costly.
There are currently millions of robots being used today, robots are used on assembly lines, painting, welding, bolting, soldering and more repetitive tasks. Robots are also being used in some supermarket stores, taking inventory, and cleaning the floors. Food preparation, national defence, social work, and medical care are sectors that are all being enhanced by robots currently.
In recent years we have seen robots further being developed for use in: <br><br>

•	Medical training, simulating various conditions and communicating symptoms to help medical students to practice diagnosis and treatment on various conditions.<br>
•	Research, robots are being developed to assist in research both in a university setting but also corporate laboratories and, at a larger scale, space exploration. Mars is home to a robot who assists
 in researching the conditions, atmosphere, and weather anomalies on Mars.<br>
•	Military and Security, robots can assist in military deployment to scout ahead for mines, search and rescue missions, support in combat and I.S.R (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance)<br>
•	Social work, robots can assist autistic children in learning to socialize, or keep dementia patients company.<br>
•	Line work, robots are currently used on assembly lines. From chopping lettuce, constructing sandwiches, assembling cars, radios, and other technology. Robots are being used for
 the monotonous and repetitive tasks, as well as dangerous or difficult ones.<br>
•	Prosthetics, perhaps the most promising development in robotics is the improvements in prosthetic and robotic limbs. Bionics, as they are commonly known, are being developed to assist in those who are missing limbs or
are paralysed. New technology is being developed to allow for these bionics to mimic biological muscular contraction and relaxation,
skin tightening and loosening, and joint movements. These innovations allow the wearers to run, jump, dance, and move exactly as they would with biological limbs.<br><br>

These developments in robotics are made possible through the research and testing done in robotic centres all over the world and can be attributed to the boom in technological advancement that we have seen over the last 10-15 years. Processing power is getting faster and more affordable as computing equipment is upgraded and updated, and with these advancements we can implement new technologies and new techniques into developing robotics.
Right now, robots are costly. But as with all new technology, this cost has been and will continue to decrease over time. In the past 30 years, the cost of robot production has halved, but experts have theorised that the cost decrease will be exponential within the next decade, potentially to the point where robots that can clean, cook, and assist in the home may be commercially available within 10 years.
<br><br>

Robot development can both be beneficial and harmful to our society. Robots are already playing a huge part in our daily lives, but by 2030, experts theorise that robot production will be cheap enough that 50 million jobs will be lost to automation.
However, robots are currently and will continue to assist humans in completing dangerous jobs as well as make their jobs easier. Robots are working with firefighters to access burning buildings, cleaning up nuclear waste, rescuing snow-related disaster victims and so much more. Over the next few years, robots are expected to develop in this direction rather than replacing or obsoleting human jobs.
Bionics are a big talking point in the robotics industry, bionics may not only assist in aiding the physically disabled
but may also develop to a point where robotic enhancements attached to our bodies allow us to lift heavy loads without
machinery, run long distances without breaking a sweat, or cross dangerous terrain without fear of injury. In the 2019 video game
release “Death Stranding” developer Kojima Productions tackled this idea by creating a world so dangerous to traverse that humanity
had developed ‘bio-suits’ to enhance the physical capabilities of human beings. This is not only in fiction but is currently being developed by Bionics researchers around the world. Individuals wearing these machines describe the
feeling as “walking with zero effort” and find that once you step outside the suit your body feels very heavy and moving your muscles is somewhat of a challenge.
In essence, robots will both enhance current jobs, making them safer and easier to complete, but given enough development, will also replace some jobs entirely especially within the hospitality and customer service sector. However, jobs within robotics will be higher in demand, as professionals with the skills to maintain and repair these robots will be sought after as more and more robots enter the workforce.
<br><br>

These developments have the potential to affect a lot of people. Personally, as I am looking to work in IT, robots
are unlikely to enter the tech industry in any reasonable timeframe. However, IT workers may end up becoming the face of
robotics and repairing a robot may become as common as repairing a PC or Laptop. In this case, a career in IT may shift to become
more about robotics and robotic coding rather than repairing PCs for human users, or coding databases with GUIs for human office workers.<br>
Some of my family and friends may be more affected than I, as robots may replace their jobs in hospitality and retail before any other industry.
Jobs might be lost and individuals within these sectors may seek to retrain and enter new careers.

<h2>Cyber Security</h2><br><br>
Cyber security is the protection of computer systems and networks from theft or damage to hardware, software, or electronic data. This is important to everyone’s lives ranging
from the person who just got their first computer all the way to the giant companies relying completely on their technology (Cisco, n.d). The cybersecurity industry is rapidly
advancing all the time and already has many new and significant advances since the industry first began in 1972. Currently the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance holds the throne
as the state-of-the-art technology used in cyber security. Its features include integrated Virtual Private Server, Virtual Private Network, antivirus, antispam, content inspection
capabilities, multi-node and automated clustering, enhanced productivity and performance, all devices can be connected via a secure and efficient network, secures IP addresses and
data centers (Cisco, n.d). It also builds upon regular firewalls which monitor the network traffic on a system or network and determine whether it can get through or not (Cisco, n.d).
You can picture it like a security guard letting people into an event, usually they make the right call but sometimes someone may get in who has no business being in there.
This raises a major issue because usually by the time someone realizes there is a problem their files could be gone, system destroyed, or even their identity stolen. Such as
happened in 2017 when the credit reporting agency that assesses the financial health of most people in the United States Equifax had a data breach. This breach led to hundreds
of millions of people having their personal information stolen and it was attacked in a vulnerable web portal that was never fixed due to their internal processes. The breachers
went from this web portal to other servers because they were not configured properly which then allowed for them to retrieve all the usernames and passwords of all existing clients
without difficulty and continue this data theft. Equifax was unaware of the breach for months because they did not renew an encryption certificate on one of the internal security
tools and after that they did not make the breach public until over a month later (Fruhlinger, 2020).  A question that came out of this is how the industry can notice those small,
disguised threats sneaking their way into your system to cause major problems. Right now, it is up to automation and humans to find out about these breaches and then act on them,
however the industry will most likely turn to artificial intelligence in cybersecurity defenses to assist in rectifying these issues (Parker, 2020). Right now, they create more of
a cybersecurity risk than a reward because when new technology is released the potential corruption is not fully known and is only determined the longer a system has been released
for and how hackers try to find the vulnerabilities within the new systems. However, on the plus side for early AI use it can automate and compute faster than a human can, which
will then allow for the possible corruption points when acted upon by an outside user or when noticed by an AI to be fixed much faster than by waiting for an actual person to notice it.
It would also be more beneficial to bring it out sooner than later so that the issues with using artificial intelligence can be highlighted earlier on in the process of using it as opposed
to trying to work out every single little kink just to find out it is still full of holes. <br><br>
Continuing, due to this current technology systems will be at less of a risk of being hacked and will allow for new technology to be fixed quicker than ever before. What is the downside of this? Well, the problem here is that those looking to cause harm to one’s systems or devices will also be able to use artificial intelligence to try and wreak havoc on those same systems or devices. Those individuals will most likely use one of two options. They will either hack into the AIs that are being used and use those to steal information and cause havoc, or they will create separate AIs that solely have the intention of causing malicious corruption (Ramachandran, 2019).
This also poses a problem for technology that does not have up to date cybersecurity software on it because as the opposing side gets stronger it will be much easier to be hacked into due to the lack of strong security. Situations such as the Equifax data breach was caused by a lot of human error that eventually led to this breach. Human error would not be an issue if it were being done by AI. Using Artificial Intelligence will affect everyone who uses technology. It will make newer technology more desirable to consumers for the updated security that will come with it. It will also save companies money because the AI can go through all data faster and more thorough
than a human could (Balbix, n.d). It will not necessarily make any jobs redundant nor will it create new ones, but it would allow for those formally tasked with going through the
data to focus more on other tasks such as upgrades to the AI or allow them to focus more on fixing the problem rather than spending time looking for these errors or points that could be breached. This will cause the cybersecurity industry to rapidly advance because people will be focusing solely on how to make things better, not fixing current mistakes.
<br><br>
In conclusion, even with this major upgrade to cybersecurity, it will most likely not affect my life or my friends and families lives very much. This is due to the fact
that cybersecurity is at its best when people are unaware it is happening. If people need to become more aware of cybersecurity that would mean that it is not entirely able
to do its job properly and has been hacked. People do not know they have a problem with cyberthreats until they break through their cyber security and notice corruptions happening
in their systems or devices. If cyber security is somehow increased to the point where hackers are unable to pass through it no matter what they
do then people will no longer become aware of threats and problems and forget that cybersecurity is even a thing. Now, will that ever happen? The short answer is no - that is
impossible. It is impossible to build up cybersecurity that strong because anything that is built can be used against those creating it as they do not fully understand it and
hackers can exploit that lack of knowledge that exists. This is typically why many games, devices or programs released have an update very shortly after being released. Someone
has found how to take advantage of a small window that the developers/creators did not even know existed. Changes in cybersecurity will have neither a positive nor a negative impact
in my life because as the industry is constantly evolving the opposing side is too. We wonder when the end of the battle between cybersecurity and cyberthreats will end,
especially with how deeply involved everyone is with their technological devices.
