  when he watched good Sci-Fi movies and shows like Star Trek, The Matrix and 2001 Space Odyssey. He has basic academic
  and practical skills in IT and hoping, like many in this course, to gain professional experience.

  <h1>Group Feedback</h1>
  <br>
  Overall, the group felt that communication went incredibly well. The group members were all very open and honest, and if they had any issues they spoke up. The chairman of the meeting was very clear with the agenda of the meetings and we stayed on topic the whole time.<br>
Organisation was also something that was key in our group functioning effectively. The meetings were clearly scheduled well ahead of time, and reminders were sent out through email. The group was all very punctual and submitted their work on time before meetings.<br>
The group felt that everyone was really easy going, and no one had any complaints when work was being assigned. Everyone was very happy to complete their work without any issues. Additionally, everyone was able to stay on track, and during meetings, make sure everyone was on track to complete their work. Everyone was very dedicated to completing the work.<br>
There was not much we agreed on that could be improved. We all felt the group dynamic was really well rounded, and not much could be done better.<br>
However, we all agreed that we could improve by starting a little earlier. We struggled to gather the group together during the Christmas break, which is understandable. With further assignments the group will work on beginning their work a lot earlier. <br>
The group also commented that there could have been more analysis of individual’s work. Proof-reading and comments so everyone is happy with how the work is being done. However, this comes down to the time constraint again, and will be fixed with a little more time.<br>
One thing that surprised us was how well everyone worked together. A lot of group members were impressed that everyone was so dedicated to the assignment and ready to get it done. Not one active group member was hesitant. <br>
Another surprising, or interesting, thing we noted was that the personality profiles match the group member’s individual personalities really well. It was really interesting to read how the group might work together and it was very surprising seeing how well the different personality types worked together. The personality types just make sense.<br>
The group all agreed that prior to our group, their opinions on group work were very negative. Past experiences or just a general stigma surrounding group work left a sour taste in our mouths. We have all learned that if you gather a group of people who are as dedicated and hardworking as the rest of the team, the group dynamic just works, and it doesn’t feel like group work. It feels like a group of friends.
