  Alex is 19 years old and was born in Kerala, a large state in India. Alex moved from India to New Zealand
  and then from NZ to Australia however, he and his family have a long running tradition of returning to India
  every two years as most of his family still live there. His family absolutely adores hearing all the different
  things about Australia. In high school he was the tech captain and has worked on making full scale working models.
  His career goals initially started with wanting to become a police officer, and later IT took his interest,
  however, instead of trading one ship for another he has decided to pursue both fields. His interest in IT began
  when he watched good Sci-Fi movies and shows like Star Trek, The Matrix and 2001 Space Odyssey. He has basic academic
  and practical skills in IT and hoping, like many in this course, to gain professional experience.
