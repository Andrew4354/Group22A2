    <br> <h1>IT Interview</h1>
    <br><br>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>
<b>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</b> <br>
This IT professional is a network engineer and architect while holding the rank of director. He leads a team that has the primary function of automating as much of the network operations
as possible. This automation must follow a set of rules called ICAPS, meet the enterprise requirement and meet WCIT requirements. Being a leader, he must also undertake management roles such as
performance reviews, track vacation time and handle complaints.
<br><br>
<b>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</b> <br>
This IT professional does not interact with the general public or with clients and states that it is best this way. It is best to be unknown in his role because client
s and investors only care about the infrastructure side of things when the networks fail. He interacts with UNIX and Sun teams. Also, user teams which handle all the clients
whether in person or virtual. Finally, he interacts with his management team to whom he reports his and his team’s work.
<br><br>
<b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b> <br>
When asked which aspects this IT professional spends most of his time, he responded by originally saying “All of them.” When asked to elaborate he expan
ded by saying automation is what most of his time is spent on. Also, based on previous answers in the interview we can gather that him and his team spend about 80
% of their time working on automating the networks and 20% of their time working on things outside of their primary job.
<br><br>
<b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b> <br>

The most challenging aspect of this position is documenting according to the Software Development Life Cycle process. He states that every component of
 code and every library that is used must be documented. This is done for every product in the organization and full documentation must be available. “...much m
 ore challenging because the internal comment has to be that we develop solution despite policies, not because of them”.

<h2>Transcript</h2>

  Connor: Can you please tell me about your IT work? What exactly do you do? <br><br>
  Milan: That's not an easy question [sighs]. My official role is Network Engineer and Architect. Uh, my rank is director. My functional role is Team L
  ead of Rapid Development. My actual work is developing automation solutions, um, with a view of automating as much of network operations as possible. <br><br>
  Connor:  Can you please tell me about the industry you work in?<br><br>
  Milan: I work in finance.<br><br>
  Connor: What other kind of work do you have to do?<br><br>
  Milan: Well, being in finance, risk is a massive part of the work. So every solution in IT that we deliver has to comply with generic IT rules, whic
  h we call ICAPS, and then there’s minimum enterprise requirements that we have to meet and document and defend, if asked. Then there’s WCIT security requirem
  ents that we have to do, which is a lot of classification of data, a lot of… like every log message needs to be classified by priority, that kind of stuff. Then
  I’m a Team Lead, so I have a lot of people management stuff I have to do. You know, from basic things like tracking vacations and whatnot to performance reviews and um
  … complaint management and tracking and handling… all of that kind of stuff. So it is a holistic role. It’s not like a contractor where you
  come in and you’re just doing the one thing that you were hired to do. Um, I actually have a full role within the organization.<br><br>
  Connor: Who are all the different people you interact with at your work? Can you tell me about them?<br><br>
  Milan: Well I work on the infrastructure side of things, which means that customers are mostly IT people, because people outside of IT
   have no clue that we even exist. And that’s kind of the point of pride, right? They don’t know we exist, it means we’re doing our job
   well. Uh, the only time when people are interested in plumbing with networks is when it fails. Um, so most of my work involves dealing
    with platforms people… so for us that’s Wintel, um, Linux, and generic UNIX, so we have HBox, we have IBN varieties, we have a bunch
     of different UNIX, we have Sun, um… and then we have user teams that are dealing mostly with either virtual or hard clients… um, mo
     stly involving things like, uh, cashing of multimedia contents, server distributions, address or locations, management of profiles,
      that sort of things. Uh, and then we have the management team, because they tend to get confused and think of automation as report
      ing, so they get super excited when they get on excel or a chart, not realizing that that’s reporting, that’s not automation, but o
      bviously it’s, um, a good way to earn a bonus and to be seen as effective. So we tend to allocate about 20 percent of our time to w
      ork that’s outside our primary mission of automation, and we tend to stray more into reporting and visualization, because management
       team has to appreciate that more because it’s easier for them to comprehend it. And it just means that overall, we are given both th
       e rewards and the visibility that helps us do the other 80 percent of our work.<br><br>
  Connor: And I presume there are no interactions with clients and investors?<br><br>
  Milan: That’s correct, there’s no clients, there’s no investors.<br><br>
  Connor: What aspects of your work do you spend the most time on?<br><br>
  Milan: All of them.<br><br>
  Connor: Can you tell me about that?<br><br>
  Milan: Sure. Writing code [sighs]. Um, anything, from let’s say a simple job of operating a certain type of netw
  ork device. Let’s say a switch. Our common switch that we have deployed in our environment, we have about 75-plus-
  thousand of them in the environment. If you take, let’s say two hours to operate each, you’re looking at 150 thous
  and hours to perform the upgrades. First, it’s prohibitive from the perspective of resources. Second, it’s prohibit
  ive from the perspective of getting the change windows; because it’s a bank, we can only do outages during weekends,
  and even during weekends there’s only prescribed times. And then there’s weekends where you’re not allowed to make ch
  anges because of business activities that are spilling over into weekends. So, 150 thousand hours is basically a nonex
  istent window to do something manually. So, the only way to really do it is to automate it. To automate it, you have to
   basically account for every possibly operation you’d do manually through an automated piece of code. A tool that does
   that does not exist, so it has to be written completely from scratch. So you need to design it, you need to make it flex
   ible so that it can be extended with minimal effort and updated with emerging requirements, and then you have to sit do
   wn and you have to write every line of code. That needs to be done because this is a network-specific function; you can
   not hire your developer to do that work,  because to explain to a developer what needs to happen would require more res
   ource time than actually writing it by a network professional. The problem with that is we simply don’t have enough net
   work professionals who know how to write code or who are available to tutor developers. So, a simple task like that, you
   ’re looking at probably two weeks of 60-hour days—or sixty-hour weeks. So let’s say 120 hours to deliver something like
   that, not counting testing, validation, production sign-offs, the process-related stuff that then follows the developmen
   t. But it’s 120 hours of development, um, so, yeah, you really need to focus and you really need to
   get it done right the first time, because you simply… because of the lack of resources that are available to do th
   is type of work, you cannot keep coming back and doing the same thing over and over, so it has to be done right. A
   nd second is, if you impact 75 thousand devices in production, you will not have a job. So, it’s a very stressful and very pedantic work.<br><br>
  Connor: Would you say that is also the most challenging aspect of your work?<br><br>
  Milan: No. Process is the most challenging aspect of the work.<br><br>
  Connor: Why is that?<br><br>
  Milan: Uh, every part of it has to be documented according to, um, SDLC process—SDLC
   stands for Software Development Life Cycle—which applies to every product that’s introduced within our orga
   nization. You have to document every component in a code, every library used. Uh, full documentation has to ava
   ilable… all the code has to be, obviously, fully tested through automated means. Uh, so CACD has to be implemente
   d. Uh, you need to then present that code in its finished iteration to UAT team. That’s usually the team that’s going to end up using it in production environment, w
  ith a test environment where they can validate that everything works correctly, and you have to supervise the valida
  tion. Then, you have to take it, um, to a production sign-off process that we call PTO, which is four separate meetings,
  where the solution has to be presented in varying levels of detail to receive approvals from architecture team, from engi
  neering team, from operations, and from risk. So, once you’ve done your work, which you’re paid to do, nobody can use it,
  unless you follow this other system. Uh, and remember you still have to perform all the risk evaluations, minimal enterprise
  requirements, all that stuff still needs to be done. That’s much more challenging because the internal comment has to be tha
  t we develop solution despite policies, not because of them.<br><br>
  Connor: And one final question. Can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?<br><br>
  Milan: Yeah, so, it really is what your primary function is. Plus, as any other maturing industry, IT has finally started to catch u
  p with the amount of support work, documentation work, and justification work that needs to be performed. Because there’s a large nu
  mber of external entities now that performs audits and provides recommendations to your employer. See, in the past, the person that
  they hired was the expert, and the company relied on their internal expert to provide systems that will meet the business needs. Wel
  l, that’s gone, alright? What they do now is they hire companies to perform audits, and as the result of the audit that company perfo
  rmed, it will issue recommendations. And those recommendations generally don’t evolve to technical aspects of work, because that’s the
   stuff you know how to do; that’s kind of digging a hole of the IT industry, right? You take a shovel and you dig a hole within your land,
    which is the work that you’re trained to do and qualified to do and experienced doing. What they recommend is how to protect the
  business from substandard work, how to protect the business from short
  cuts, how to protect the business from malicious behavior. And all of those things add layers and layers of additional work
   that’s not directly related to the work that you’re doing, yet has become an integral part of participating in enterprise IT
   . And because all of those are corporation-and-industry-specific, it’s very hard to get trained on it, and we’re finding that a lo
   t of new people that we hire are actually shocked with the amount of work and justification they need to do, even before starting any of
    the qualified work [air quotes]. So, yeah, I would
   like to say that presentation, written and verbal skills, attention to detail, ability to be flexible involving environment, is probabl
   y 30 to 40 percent of IT work in a modern organization. And 60 percent remains the technical aspects of work that you’re
   qualified and looking to do. So yeah, kind of evolution of IT in twenty-first century.<br><br>
  Connor: Alright, well I know you have a meeting soon. <br><br>
  Milan: That’s right, I have to go. <br><br>
  Connor: Thank you for your time.<br><br>
  Milan: My pleasure.<br><br>
